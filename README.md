Create
Read
Update
Delete

-- Web Api Basics: Practice and went through Web Api Controllers, Model Binding, Routing, Model Validation with DataAnnotation, 
                                              Model Validation with Validation Attribute, Web API Return types, 
                                              Introduction to In-Memory Repository and Model Validation with Action Filter
